Thanks so much for using Tahoma2D.
I thrilled to announce that Tahoma2D 1.1 is now available.
Here are some of the things you can expect in the new version:
Over 100 bug fixes, tweaks and new features. Vanishing points and advanced straight line drawing on Vector levels. You can now snap straight lines to 15 degree intervals for greater precision. The vector brush can now draw behind, auto close and auto fill strokes.</description></item><item><title>Tahoma2D 1.1 Beta is now available!</title><link>https://tahoma2d.org/posts/2020/10/16/11beta1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tahoma2d.org/posts/2020/10/16/11beta1/</guid><description>Hi folks!

Throughout developement, a primary focus is on usability. I think that Tahoma2D has taken many great steps forward in that regard. There are also a bunch of new features to try- including features in OpenToonz that have been added since the 1.4 branch, as well as many features that are exclusive to Tahoma2D.
You can try it out here!</description></item><item><title>Beta 3 is Out!</title><link>https://tahoma2d.org/posts/2020/07/21/beta3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tahoma2d.org/posts/2020/07/21/beta3/</guid><description>Beta 3 is out now. Beta 2 accidentally didn&amp;rsquo;t ship with DSLR support, that is back in Beta 3. There are also a few bug fixes. This is also the first beta to have Mac support.
